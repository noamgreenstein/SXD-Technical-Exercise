Part 1: Math <br/>
if $x_1 + x_2 \leq 5$ , $2x_1 + x_2 \leq 8$ , and $x_1 , x_2 \geq 0$ <br/>
then you can subtract the first equation from the second one to get you: $x_1 \leq 3$<br/>
since $x_1 \leq 3$ then $x_2 \leq 2$ <br/>
since we're looking for the min: Min $x_1 = 0$ and Min $x_2 = 0$ <br/>
So, Min Z $= -3 * 0 + 0 = 0$ <br/> <br/>

What type of database would you choose? Why? <br/>
I chose a relational database (mySQL) because it provides strong data integrity features and can handle sub-millisecond latency <br/>
Assume your target user audience are all math students in the US. How would you size
your database accordingly? What strategies would you consider to prevent overloading a
single database instance with requests? <br/>
